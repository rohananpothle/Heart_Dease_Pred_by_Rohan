# Heart Disease Prediction

Heart disease is a leading cause of death for people of most races in the U.S. (African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and whites). 
In this project we have predicted whether individuals have heart disease or not (HeartDisease column). 
This dataset includes information on 18 variables.

There are more than 3 lakhs records in this dataset.

Created separate .py files for model training and prediction.

Make sure that our dataset during the model building and prediction phase gone through the same data processing and feature creation steps.

# Target Column

HeartDisease ‚Äì Binary classification: Yes or No (whether the individual has heart disease)

| 5    | `Diabetic_Yes`            | Diabetes strongly correlates with heart disease.  |
| 6    | `AgeCategory_75-79`       | Age continues to be an important factor.          |
| 7    | `GenHealth_Poor`          | Poor self-reported health = higher risk.          |
